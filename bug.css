The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be unexpected behavior if spaces are not correctly placed around the operators (+, -, *, /). For example, `width:calc(100% - 10px)` works fine, while `width:calc(100%-10px)` will likely result in an error. This is because the browser might not parse the expression correctly if it is missing spaces around the operators.
